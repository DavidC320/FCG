    working on the template for the comic.

    Future Problems:
        The comic panels could leak into other panels which can cause issues so I think the best course of action is to create 4 seperate images then combine them later.
        I'll keep the default image as a fall back and refrence.

    Todo:
        1. create 4 and 3 panel support
            4 panels.
                size = (275, 275)

            3 panels.
                size = (183, 550)

            reminders:
                the panels will have different locations for characters, single bubbles, text
                also difrent sizes for those things

                when there is 1 line, the line is in the center 1/2
                when there is 2 lines,  the lines are in a 1/3
                when there is 3 lines, the lines are in a 1/4
                all of these are anchered to the center
                a conversion equation for length of text to font size
                29 # Length / 15 # size * ? / 45

            information:
                the text limit is 29
                the minimum size for 29 is 15
                maximum lines = 3
                line length = 29
                minimum font size = 15
                maximum font size = 45
